If changes to the paths to these files becomes necessary, please note that they must be made for `index.html` to process the stylesheet `styles.css`, the JavaScript file `scripts.js`, and the favicon `favicon.ico` and use the appropriate styling and function calls when appropriate.

# Using styles.css

`styles.css` is a stylesheet directly relating to the IDs as they are found in the file `index.html`. 
The exact IDs and classes used by this file are subject to change, if and when further changes to this file are made by its author(s). Any developer using these files publicly can also decide to edit certain rulesets and the html tags they refer to as is necessary.

# Using scripts.js
