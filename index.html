        <!-- 
            A brief explanation of why outputting "Hello World!" is a program that most developers learn to create. 
        -->
        <p id="overview">
            Hello World was one of the first things ever programmed. Because of this, many programmers first learn how to output the sentence "Hello World!" to their screen when beginning to learn a new programming language. The exact method of doing so varies between languages, and an example of this can be found at the bottom of this page.
        </p>

        <!-- 
            Adding some space between the introductory paragraph and the notes about the example code found on this website.

        <br>

        <!-- A message prefacing that code snippets have been organized by the coding language in question. -->
        <p id="introduction">A few examples of the code used to print Hello World! to a user's screen are provided below, alongside the language that each snippet is written in.</p>

        <!-- 
            A paragraph informing the viewer of this site that only the exact code that prints out the phrase "Hello World!" can be found on this website, not what would be found on a full file for that coding language. 

            The user is also told how the cases where "Hello World!" can be printed out multiple ways is handled on this site.
        -->
        <p id="disclaimer">
            Notes: The code snippets only show the actual code that executes the command to print out the phrase "Hello World!" to the user, not any code required to make that command work without errors. Ex. A Java "Hello World!" program uses a main method, which is not included on this page. <br> In the cases where there are multiple correct answers, the word or will be placed between the two ways of printing "Hello World!". The word or is NOT part of the code to print the phrase "Hello World!" to the screen of the user.
